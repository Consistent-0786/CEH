Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and Netbios Name Service (NBT-NS) are two components of Microsoft Windows machines.  LLMNR was introduced in Windows Vista and is the successor to NBT-NS.

When a DNS name server request fails, Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution(LLMNR) and Net-BIOS Name Service(NBT-NS) is used by Windows machines as a fallback. If the DNS name still remains unresolved, the windows performs an unauthenticated UDP broadcast to the whole network. Any masquerading machine, claiming to be the server then sends a response and capture the target's credentials during the authentication process.

**LLMNR/NBT-NS Spoofing attack** is a classical internal network attack that still works, due to low awareness and the fact it's enabled by default in Windows.

LLMNR and NBT-NS are enabled by default in Windows and can be used to extract the passwords hashes from a user. There is a good chance of acquiring the user credentials on a internal network.

By listening for LLMNR/NBT-NS broadcast requests, it is possible for an attacker to spoof itself as the server and send a response claiming to be the legitimate server. After the victim system accepts the connection, it is possible to gain the victim's user-credentials by using a tool like Responder.py.

note: 
LLMNR (link local multicast name resolution) and NBT-NS (netbios namer service) are used to performe name resolution on the local link.

Responder is LLMNR, NBT-NS, MDNS poisoner. By default the tool only responds to SMB.

#### Lab Objectives
Perform active online attack to crack the system’s password using Responder

#### Step by Step
 1. Open Parrot Security
 2. check the interfaces (if config)
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a25debd-1623-4ea5-b7a4-b8df621a32c4" height=50%>
 3. Run **sudo reponder -I eth0**
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe43d4de-01df-4d23-86c0-ce4d409a1690" height=50%>
    notes:
    -I: specifies the interface (here, eth0). However, the network interface might be different in your machine, to check the interface issue ifconfig command.
 4. Responder starts listening to the network interface for events, as shown in the screenshot.

##### Question 6.1.1.1
Run the Responder tool on the Parrot Security machine and find the NTLM hash for the user Jason on Windows 11. Simulate the user Jason (user: Jason and password: qwerty) on the Windows 11 machine. Enter the option that specifies the interface while running the Responder tool.
**Answer: -I**
