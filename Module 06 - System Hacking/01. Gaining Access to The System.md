### TASK 01 - Perform Active Online Attack to Crack the System’s Password using Responder

Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and Netbios Name Service (NBT-NS) are two components of Microsoft Windows machines.  LLMNR was introduced in Windows Vista and is the successor to NBT-NS.

When a DNS name server request fails, Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution(LLMNR) and Net-BIOS Name Service(NBT-NS) is used by Windows machines as a fallback. If the DNS name still remains unresolved, the windows performs an unauthenticated UDP broadcast to the whole network. Any masquerading machine, claiming to be the server then sends a response and capture the target's credentials during the authentication process.

**LLMNR/NBT-NS Spoofing attack** is a classical internal network attack that still works, due to low awareness and the fact it's enabled by default in Windows.

LLMNR and NBT-NS are enabled by default in Windows and can be used to extract the passwords hashes from a user. There is a good chance of acquiring the user credentials on a internal network.

By listening for LLMNR/NBT-NS broadcast requests, it is possible for an attacker to spoof itself as the server and send a response claiming to be the legitimate server. After the victim system accepts the connection, it is possible to gain the victim's user-credentials by using a tool like Responder.py.

note: 
LLMNR (link local multicast name resolution) and NBT-NS (netbios namer service) are used to performe name resolution on the local link.

Responder is LLMNR, NBT-NS, MDNS poisoner. By default the tool only responds to SMB.

#### Lab Objectives
Perform active online attack to crack the system’s password using Responder

#### Step by Step
1. Open Parrot Security
2. check the interfaces (if config)

3. Run **sudo reponder -I eth0**

   notes:
   -I: specifies the interface (here, eth0). However, the network interface might be different in your machine, to check the interface issue ifconfig command.
